Issue Type: New Feature Request
--------------------------------

* Write your concrete practical scenarios with the new feature you want.
* Write your expectation how your suggestion helps others as well.
* Do not file a request like "support a new input/output/filter" here.
  * That's not for here.
  * Embulk is plugin-based. Such inputs/outputs/filters are to be implemented as plugins, not in the core.
  * It is recommended for you to search for existing plugins at first.
    * See: https://plugins.embulk.org/
  * If you cannot find existing plugins, it's a good chance for you to create a new plugin by yourself. :)
